#General description

`exp` is to `logÌ€ what `less` is to `more`.

Also, exp is "Extra Petit".

Ideas come from *petit* (http://crunchtools.com/software/petit/). That
tool is really cool, but it is way too slow on my small Cubieboard,
because it is written in Python. Also, petit's last commit is getting
old. Is it still maintained?

That's why I wanted to code a clone in C.
